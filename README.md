# Bookbot

This is a [guided project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python) I completed as a part of the Boot.dev back-end developer curriculum.The project is a simple cli program that analyzes novels and prints a report of the amount of words and characters found in the book. It is a simple introduction to working in a local development environment, building full projects from scratch, and deploying projects to GitHub.

## Usage

Python is required to run this application.

Clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal from the project root directory:

```bash
python3 main.py <book_file>
```

Where `<book_file>` is the path to the book you want to analyze. The program will read the book and print a report of the number of words and characters found in the book.
